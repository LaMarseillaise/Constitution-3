# Constitution-3

_A Charter of Democratic Renewal_

**Constitution 3** is an experimental reimagining of constitutional governance for the 21st century. Drawing on historical principles, legal theory, and pragmatic reforms, it proposes a structured, modular, and adaptable framework for organizing state power, protecting liberties, and ensuring accountability.

**Why "Constitution 3"?**

The name **Constitution 3** reflects the idea of a third foundational charter for the United States:

1. The first was the **Articles of Confederation** (1777–1789), a loose confederation with limited central authority.
2. The second is the **1789 Constitution**, which established a stronger federal government and remains in force today.
3. This project proposes a **third** constitution—one that retains democratic legitimacy while addressing the institutional, legal, and social challenges of the modern era.
